# MultiPEN

MultiPEN is a tool for the analysis of multi-omics data. We are developing the first version 0.0.1 which provides tools to analyse transcriptomics and metabolomics data. We are extending an approach based on a regularised logistic regression model [1] that uses a biological network as a priori knowledge.

A general overview of the workflow of omics data analysis is presented in the following figure.

We are applying MultiPEN in a diet intervention study to analyse gene expression data and metabolomics data (more details will be available soon!).
